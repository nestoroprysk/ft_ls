- buff + len should be implemented as a vector

- parse data on file type
- display and finding files should be separated
- implement a buffer for optimized write() calls
- fill_file_info flags may become a pointer
- save path to file
- pointer to tail
- effective -R
- try using more pure functions
- make files_left inline
- consider ft_meft_memalloc while allocating flags
- test define_file_type
- optimise merging path and file name
- it is inefficient to save all the data: I should release and display it continuously
- eliminate ft_strlen
