- Create Makefile for the main program ===DONE===
- Create Makefile for the LogicLib ===DONE===
- Configure the main project with the LogicLib ===DONE===
- Test strjoin ===DONE===
- Write the program to list all the files in a hardcoded directory ===DONE===
- get file's data ===DONE===
- parse flags ===DONE===
- handle illegal flags ===DONE===
- implement -R behaviour ===DONE===
- investigate why sort needs <=, not just < ===DONE===
- stat should be called only once ===DONE===
- right alignment ===DONE===
- buff + len should be implemented as a vector ===DONE===
- hidden vs unhidden total ===DONE===
- correct total ===DONE===
- save path to file ===DONE===
- pointer to tail ===DONE===
- effective -R ===DONE===
- try using more pure functions ===DONE===
- consider ft_meft_memalloc while allocating flags ===DONE===
- eliminate ft_strlen ===DONE===
- st_blocks ===DONE===
- separate hidden and unhidden alignment ===DONE===

- -R displays too many files ===IN PROGRESS===

- free
- parse data on file type
- display and finding files should be separated
- implement a buffer for optimized write() calls
- test define_file_type
- optimise merging path and file name
- it is inefficient to save all the data: I should release and display it continuously
- separate h files
- ls -l TODO.txt -> TODO.txt is not displayed
- the name of the directory should be displayed iff we display content of more then one directory (iff there are two or more input directories or -R has directories to go into)
